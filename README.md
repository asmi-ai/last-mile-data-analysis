## Problem Statement 🍕

Kanav has started his own Pizza Store by getting the Franchise from the popular Pizza brand Diminos. The store currently is running completely online and Kanav has hired a team of delivery personnel to deliver the pizza on time to the customers. In order to increase the revenue and profits Kanav is already running the store 24 * 7.
As per Diminos policies, Kanav’s Pizza Store promises to deliver the pizza order within 30 minutes from the time the order was placed. Failure to meet this commitment results in the pizza being free for the customer. Recently Diminos gave a notice to Kanav that there will be an audit scheduled and Kanav is particularly concerned about two key performance metrics: Delivery Time and Customer Satisfaction. These metrics are pivotal in determining the overall success and viability of the store, and failure to meet expectations could jeopardize the franchise relationship.

Moreover, as Kanav has hired a team of delivery personnels, he is also facing difficulty in capacity planning for the Delivery Fleet. Capacity planning for the delivery fleet is a crucial aspect for ensuring timely and efficient deliveries.
